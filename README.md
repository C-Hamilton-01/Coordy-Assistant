# Coordy-Assistant
Welcome to Coordy, your commercial coordinator assistant. 

The Coordy Assistant is a Google Sheets add-on built to streamline the workflow for coordinators working on commercial productions.


✨ Features (For Now)
-Import Vendors  
Easily import vendor data into your sheet and renumber to keep everything organized.

-Generate Purchase Orders  
Automatically generate and number blank Purchase Orders (POs) using a predefined template. The add-on does not fill out PO details—just creates, renames, and renumbers the sheets.


🎯 Intended Use
This tool is designed specifically for production coordinators working in commercials to save time and reduce repetitive tasks in managing POs.

-To use this add-on, Install through Google Marketplace and then refresh your sheets.

A menu will be added called "Coordy"
Here you will see the options to: Import Vendors, Rename Vendors, and Organize sheets by numeric order.

-In a sperate Sheets document, any blank one will do, paste your list of PO Vendors into column A. 
-Copy the URL of that sheet then go back to your PO sheets. 

-Click the menu Coordy and click "Import Vendors". In the Pop up, paste the URL and click OK. 

-The next popup will ask if you want them reordered by their PO numbers. 

-Let the POs generate and then there will a pop up letting you know it is complete!
